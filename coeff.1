.Sh NAME
.Nm coeff
.Nd compare sensor and certificate coefficients
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm coeff
.Op Ar directory
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility differentially compares sensor coefficients between
calibration certficates and instrument log captures.
.Pp
The mounted ISO9660 or FAT filesystem, or optional
.Ar directory ,
is recursively searched for sensor coefficients,
and all values found are compared.
Only one ISO9660 or FAT filesystem may be mounted at a time.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width "/usr/local/share/coeff/coeff.lstXXX" -compact
.It Pa /usr/local/share/coeff/coeff.lst
Sorted list of record value pairs from NetSuite.
.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Ex -std coeff
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr sort 1 ,

.Nm
was written by
.An Chris Hettrick Aq chris@structfoo.com .
.Sh CAVEATS
Tested only on Xchange series instruments and sensors.
.Pp
The file
.Pa /usr/local/share/coeff/coeff.lst
must be sorted with
.Xr sort 1
before executing
.Nm .
